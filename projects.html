      ProDataLab, a software engineering company whose flagship product, pdlPlatform, is an application 
      framework built around an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">FBP</a>
      environment. It takes advantage of every possible efficiency by 
      processing data via streams. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The intention is to build an extremely flexible, parallel, infinitely 
      scalable and distributed application services system for every type and size of data set and for any 
      application purpose.. analyzing, learning, processing, controlling, visualizing and reporting, etc. 
      Fast, efficient
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroMQ">ZeroMQ</a>
      messaging will be used as the core of it's communication fabric. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pdlPlatform will eat extremely large data sets for breakfast.. and with a user interface so easy 
      to use, a four year&ndash;old can run the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following features are part of the road map that makes ProDataLab's pdlPlatform revolutionary:
  </p>
  <hr />
  <ul>
    <li>
      Everything comprised in the system is a loosely coupled component.. user interface, scheduler/router, 
      as well as each application service. Hardware components used in the system are also very loosely coupled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inspired by, and to be modeled upon 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-Based Programming (FBP)</a>
        originating from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Morrison">J. Paul Morrison</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first user interface to be designed will be a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming">Visual Programming</a>
      Environment for the personal computer 
      and written in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28framework%29">Qt</a>
      with platform portability in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automatic recognition and adaption of all available hardware resources will be a strong focus including 
      single-core, multi-core, GPU, networked remotes, hand-held, embedded, as well as antiquated processing hardware.
    </li>
    <li>
      Smart utilization of all available resources for automated concurrency and massive parallelism.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automatic recognition and adaption of processor/network throughput and latencies for the most efficient 
      data-flow dispatching, scheduling and routing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability for community based, social collaboration over the internet.. distributed processing â€“ hardware sharing, 
      data sharing, shared visualization, etc.. a decentralized model of seti@home and folding@home for your project 
      types and needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Component application-service types, can include anything related to data, and will by no means be limited to: 
      statistics, visualization, financial markets, database access, data mining, control systems, sensor networks, 
      plotting and visualization, machine learning, business intelligence and enterprise solutions, satellite imaging, 
      algorithmic complexity, neural network, simulation modeling, bio-informatics, industrial or business automation, 
      environmental, medical, telecom, etc, etc, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroMQ">ZeroMQ</a>, any of the system's components can be easily and transparently contributed to the system from 
      approximately 20 different programming languages.. and counting.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The architecture of the pdlPlatform has been thoroughly defined and is now in the process of being implemented. 
    At ProDataLab, community is very important and so, one is soon to be established around it.
